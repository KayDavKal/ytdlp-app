# ytdlp app
This is a application for currently the pc which downloads audio from youtube and soundcloud and plays the music with a built in player!
I'll still make some updates to it but till now its completly functional for a test run.
# buildozer
You can use `buildozer` to pack this app into a apk with `buildozer -v android debug`. Documentation of buildozer is found [here](https://buildozer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
# Streaming Platform support
This app supports links from `youtube` and `soundcloud`. I'm trying to implement `spotify` aswell!
